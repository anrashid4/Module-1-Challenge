# Module-1-Challenge
Outcomes based on Launch Date and Outcomes based on goals challenge sheets
### Challenge
During the module 1 challenge, we were expected to grab data from the kickstarter sheet and extract outcomes of plays based on a certain goal and also based on a launch date. From this extraction, I noticed that the most successful plays tend to occur during May-July and then drop down dramatically during the months of October - December. Attached to this Repository is two graphs that both display different ideas. The "Outcomds based on Goal" line chart displays a certain range of goal values and the percentage of successful, fauled, and canceled plays based on that range. The "Outcomes based on Launch date" displays the number of successful, failed, canceled, and live plays based on 4 quarters throughout several years. Although this data can be used to determine when plays should be held and the goal in terms of money, they do pose some limitations because they do not display location of where these plays are occurring.
